Introduction
Agentic AI represents an advancement in autonomous systems, increasingly enabled by large language
models (LLMs) and generative AI. While agentic AI predates modern LLMs, their integration with generative
AI has significantly expanded their scale, capabilities, and associated risks. This document is the first in a
series of guides from the OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI) to provide a threat-model-based reference
of emerging agentic threats and discuss mitigations.

This document:
        Defines the scope and audience
        Provides a definition of agentic terms, capabilities, and architecture
        Discusses threat modelling approaches and provides a reference threat model discussing new
        agentic threats and mitigations
        Illustrates the threats in different settings with threat models for four example scenarios
        Documents threats with a structured and detailed Agentic Threat Taxonomy
        Details mitigations and playbooks




Scope and Audience
Our work focuses on agents based on large language models (LLMs), as these general-purpose models
revolutionize agentic development and, unlike previous agentic generations, bring more capabilities and
widespread use.

We aim to provide an easy-to-follow, practical, and actionable reference to threats and mitigations of
Agentic AI applications. We introduce some basic concepts and use a reference architecture of agentic AI,
acting as the canvas for threat models, to explain and contextualize agentic threats. However, providing a
detailed definition and architecture of agentic AI is beyond the scope of our work.

Our work focuses on Agentic AI threats and relies on existing guidelines and standards, such as the OWASP
Top 10 for LLM Applications and Generative AI, OWASP AI Exchange, OWASP Top 10, and the OWASP Top 10
for APIs to address related aspects inherent in building AI applications. When relevant, we highlight Agentic
AI's impact on existing threats and risks.

The intended audience of this document are builders and defenders of agentic applications, including
developers, architects, platform and QA engineers, and security professionals. This is our first report, and
we plan to provide additional role-based guides as follow-ups to this document for technical and decision-
making audiences.

AI Agents
An agent is an intelligent software system designed to perceive its environment, reason about it, make
decisions, and take actions to achieve specific objectives autonomously. More specifically, " Russell and
Norvig define agents in their classic “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach” as follows:

“An intelligent agent is "an agent that acts appropriately for its circumstances and its goals, is flexible to
changing environments and goals, learns from experience, and makes appropriate choices given its perceptual
and computational limitations." (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th ed., p. 34”)

AI Agents use Machine Learning (ML) for reasoning; traditional ML approaches (such as Reinforcement
Learning) play a key role in each development. The Open AI Gym (now Farama Foundation’s Gymnasium),
helped drive the first wave of Agentic AI. However, the advanced capabilities, NLP interface, and scale of
LLMs have revolutionized agentic AI and accelerated adoption.

As well-known vendors and enterprises are embracing LLM agents, Gartner forecasts that by 2028 33% of
enterprise software applications will utilize agentic AI “enabling 15% of day-to-day work decisions to be made
autonomously”.




Core Capabilities
There are many ways to describe an agent, but typically, an agent or agentic AI system will exhibit the
following elements:

        Planning & Reasoning: Agents can reason and decide about the steps necessary to achieve their
        objectives. This includes formulating, tracking, and updating their action plans to handle complex
        tasks (the Reason + Act, ReAct pattern). Modern Agents use LLMs as their reasoning engines, with
        agents using the LLM to decide the control flow of the application. This is a fundamental aspect of
        agentic autonomy. Use of reinforcement in this new generation of agents still plays a role but as a
        mechanism to improve training and reasoning, not core reasoning. This is described in “OpenAI
        Computer-User Agent research preview, a state-of-the-art agent performing interactive web tasks
        for users”. See https://openai.com/index/operator-system-card/

        Advances in LLMs have allowed for sophisticated reasoning and planning strategies such as:




genai.owasp.org                                                                                           Page 4
           ○   Reflection, where the agent evaluates past actions and their results to determine future
               plans or behaviors. Self-Critic, is a key component of reflection, where the agent critiques
               its own reasoning or output to identify and correct errors.
           ○   Chain of Thought is a step-by-step reasoning process in which the agent breaks down
               complex problems into sequential, logical steps. This can involve multi-step workflows,
               including ones without human interaction (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903).
           ○   Subgoal Decomposition, which involves dividing a main goal into smaller, manageable tasks
               or milestones to achieve the overall objective .

       There is also growing use of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic systems as models under 10
       billion parameters begin to offer sufficient power for agentic applications while offering lower costs
       (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02153).

       Memory / Statefulness to retain and recall information. This is either information from previous
       runs or the previous steps it took in the current run (i.e., the reasoning behind their actions, tools
       they called, the information they retrieved, etc.). Memory can either be session-based short-term or
       persistent long-term memory.
       Action and Tool Use: Agents can take action to accomplish tasks and invoke tools as part of the
       actions. These can be built-in tools and functions such as browsing the web, conducting complex
       mathematical calculations, and generating or running executable code in response to a user’s query.
       Agents can access more advanced tools via external API calls and a dedicated Tools interface. The
       Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a standardized interface to connect an Agent (MCP Client)
       with a tool (MCP Server). These are complemented by augmented LLMs, which offer the tool
       invocation from code generated by the model via function calling, a specialized form of tool use.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                       Page 5
Agents and LLM Applications
LLM applications can exhibit agency and agentic behavior as described in the OWASP Top 10 for LLM
Applications as part of the Excessive Agency. Also, agents can be written as LLM applications with the ability
to reason and take action using tools like APIs, databases and so on beyond just generating text-based
output.




Increasingly, developers use agentic AI frameworks, which encapsulate agentic capabilities and offer
greater productivity and reuse. Popular frameworks include LangChain/LangFlow, AutoGen, CrewAI, and so
on.

        For a more in-depth guide on the available frameworks and tools, please refer to the OWASP Agentic
        AI Landscape




genai.owasp.org                                                                                        Page 6
        You can find examples of LLM agents written using these popular frameworks in our OWASP ASI
        GitHub repository.. These are intentionally built vulnerable agents to demonstrate vulnerabilities
        and can also exemplify how agents work.

Autonomy and agency can also vary depending on the style of orchestration in the agent, ranging from
hardcoded to constrained via code or finite-state machine workflows (LangFlow) and fully conversational,
where decisions depend purely on interactions and model reasoning. See https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12469
for further details on levels of autonomy.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                        Page 7
Agentic AI Reference
Architecture
The capabilities described above are implemented as part of the agent software but do not inherently
translate into standalone, deployable components unless explicitly designed that way. While it is possible to
build fully modular and externally accessible agent components, doing so adds significant complexity. In
practice, most agent deployments integrate these capabilities within the software itself rather than
exposing them as independent services.

Our aim is to bring together capabilities and concepts found in research and other literature with the
developer experiences by mapping capabilities to components.

The following diagram illustrates single-agent architecture, highlighting the key deployable components
relevant to our threat modeling.




Single Agent Architecture




Deployable components will include:



genai.owasp.org                                                                                          Page 8
    1.   An application that has embedded agentic functionality to perform tasks for the user on behalf of
         the user, often outside a specific user session.
    2.   An agent generally accepts natural language input similar to inputs used for NLP models. This will
         be textual prompts and optional media such as files, images, sound, or video. The application's code
         implements the core capabilities and most likely relies on abstractions offered by an agentic
         framework (LangChain/LangFlow, AutoGen, Crew.AI, and so on).
    3.   One or more LLM models (local or remote) are used for reasoning.
    4.   Services, including built-in functions, local tools, and local application code, local or remote and
         external services, will be called in two possible manners:
             a. Function calling and optional Tools interface at the framework/application level
             b. Function calling by an LLM model returning invocation code to the agent.
    5.   Supporting services, part of the agent infrastructure and core functionality:
             a. External Storage for persistent Long-term memory.
             b. Other data sources include a vector database, other data object storage repositories, and
                 content used in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG related sources can also be
                 seen as part of the tools, but we highlight it here as a core supporting service that can be
                 used in any LLM application.




Multi-agent Architecture
A multi-agent architecture comprises multiple agents that can scale or combine specialist roles and
functionality in an agentic solution. In both cases, the architecture is similar except for introducing inter-
agent communication and, optionally, a coordinating agent. There is a protocol called Agent2Agent (A2A)
that defines a standard specification for multi agent system communication. See for example the use of a
coordinating supervisor agent in a multi-agent architecture using Amazon bedrock.



Depending on the solution, different specialist agents may be introduced with additional capabilities, such
as the core ones we have defined. The following diagram illustrates an example of multi-agent architecture
with additional specialized roles and capabilities:




genai.owasp.org                                                                                           Page 9
The diagram depicts an example of multi-agent architecture of specialized agent functionality. Specialized
functionality is a form of agentic patterns and could be exhibited by any agent depending on the use case.




Agentic AI Patterns
Specialized roles and planning strategies contribute to agentic patterns. These patterns are emerging as
building blocks that can be combined in a single agent; they can help us understand large-scale
architectures and aid efficient threat-modeling conversations with consistent language. A detailed
treatment of agentic patterns is beyond the scope of ASI’s work, but we provide the below descriptions to
help standardize conversations in threat modeling.


       Pattern                                                Description

 Reflective Agent      Agents that iteratively evaluate and critique their own outputs to enhance performance.
                       Example: AI code generators that review and debug their own outputs, like Codex with self-
                       evaluation.

 Task-Oriented Agent   Agents designed to handle specific tasks with clear objectives. Example: Automated
                       customer service agents for appointment scheduling or returns processing.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                             Page 10
 Hierarchical Agent   Agents are organized in a hierarchy, managing multi-step workflows or distributed control
                      systems. Example: AI systems for project management where higher-level agents oversee
                      task delegation.

 Coordinating Agent   Agents facilitate collaboration and coordination and tracking, ensuring efficient execution.
                      Example: a coordinating agent assigns subtasks to specialized agents, such as in AI-
                      powered DevOps workflows where one agent plans deployments, another monitors
                      performance, and a third handles rollbacks based on system feedback.

 Distributed Agent    Agents interact within a decentralized ecosystem, often in applications like IoT or
 Ecosystem            marketplaces. Example: Autonomous IoT agents managing smart home devices or a
                      marketplace with buyer and seller agents.

 Human-in-the-Loop    Agents operate semi-autonomously with human oversight. Example: AI-assisted medical
 Collaboration        diagnosis tools that provide recommendations but allow doctors to make final decisions.

 Self-Learning and    Agents adapt through continuous learning from interactions and feedback. Example: Co-
 Adaptive Agents      pilots, which adapt to user interactions over time, learning from feedback and adjusting
                      responses to better align with user preferences and evolving needs.

 RAG-Based Agent      This pattern involves the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where AI agents
                      utilize external knowledge sources dynamically to enhance their decision-making and
                      responses. Example: Agents performing real-time web browsing for research assistance.

 Planning Agent       Agents autonomously devise and execute multi-step plans to achieve complex objectives.
                      Example: Task management systems organizing and prioritizing tasks based on user goals.

 Context- Aware       Agents dynamically adjust their behavior and decision-making based on the context in which
 Agent                they operate. Example: Smart home systems adjusting settings based on user preferences
                      and environmental conditions.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                              Page 11
Agentic AI Threat Model
Threat modeling approach
Threat modeling is a structured, repeatable process for identifying and mitigating security risks in a system.
It involves analyzing a system from an adversarial perspective, identifying potential threats, and determining
appropriate defenses. Ideally integrated into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), threat modeling is
an ongoing process that evolves with the system. As outlined in the Threat Modeling Manifesto, it addresses
four key questions:

    ●   What are we working on?
    ●   What can go wrong?
    ●   What are we going to do about it?
    ●   Did we do a good enough job?

There are established methodologies, such as STRIDE or PASTA that help practitioners perform threat
modeling, but they are rooted in traditional cyber vulnerabilities and must be expanded or mapped to AI
vulnerabilities. You can find out more about threat modelling in application development and threat
modelling methodologies in the OWASP Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet and the OWASP Top 10 for LLM GenAI
Red Teaming guide, which discusses Threat Modeling for Generative AI/LLM Systems.



A comprehensive extension to STRIDE to handle Agentic AI is the layered-based MAESTRO methodology
which offers a detailed lens to identify Agentic Threats through the use of architectural layers.
Methodologies can impose cognitive barriers, deterring newcomers from understanding emerging threats in
leading-edge technology settings. Furthermore, methodologies like MAESTRO cover both agentic as well as
traditional ML and application threats, and our explicit focus is on Agentic threats.

As a result, in this document, we do not follow a specific methodology, but we focus on the use of our
reference architecture to identify and explain threats, their attack scenarios, relationship to applicable LLM
Top 10, and respective mitigations.

We recommend that practitioners evaluate and use a methodology that suits their organizational context,
noting the agentic extensions that MAESTRO brings.




Reference Threat Model


genai.owasp.org                                                                                        Page 12
Agentic applications have threats related to the application layer, API, and ML/LLMs, making it imperative
that these threats are identified and addressed in your own threat model.

Since general threats not specific to agentic systems are already covered in other OWASP guides, it is out of
the scope of this document to include them. For further details on general threats, please refer to:

        OWASP Top 10 2021 (and the forthcoming 2025 edition)
        OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks – 2023
        OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications and Generative AI for 2025
        OWASP AI Exchange
        MITRE Atlas
        NIST AI 100-2 E2023 Adversarial ML - A taxonomy of threats and mitigations

Agentic AI threats are either new or agentic variations of existing threats. Some notable threats are the
result of new components that agentic AI application architecture brings. We discuss in detail threats and
mitigations in the next two sections; this section introduces the new threats and risks as part of the reference
threat model.

Agent Memory and Tools integration become two key attack vectors susceptible to memory poisoning and
tools misuse especially in contexts of unconstrained autonomy either in advanced planning strategies or
multi-agent architectures where agents learn from each other’s conversations. Tool misuse relates to LLM
Top 10’s excessive agency but introduces new complexities we discuss in greater detail in our Agentic
Threats Taxonomy section. An area where tools misuse requires more attention is code generation creating
new attack vectors and risks for Remote Code Execution (RCE) and code attacks.

The usage of tools as part of agentic environments also affects identity and authorization, making it a critical
security challenge that can potentially lead to the violation of intended trust boundaries.

As identity flows into integrated tools and APIs, a Confused Deputy vulnerability arises when an AI agent
(the "deputy") has higher privileges than the user but is tricked into performing unauthorized actions on the
user’s behalf. This typically occurs when an agent lacks proper privilege isolation and cannot distinguish
between legitimate user requests with proper authorizations and adversarial injected instructions. For
example, if an AI agent is allowed to execute database queries but does not properly validate user input and
credentials, an attacker could trick it into executing high-privilege queries that the attacker themselves
would not have direct access to.

To mitigate this, it is essential to properly scope agent entitlements by applying the principle of least
privileges when operating on behalf of users, and validate whether users submitting the prompts have
proper authorization to perform the requested actions. This is essential to prevent hijacking control via
prompt injections and Identity spoofing and impersonation.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                          Page 13
Additionally, Non-Human Identities (NHI)—such as machine accounts, service identities, and agent-based
API keys—play a key role in agentic AI security. Agents often operate under NHIs when interfacing with cloud
services, databases, and external tools. Unlike traditional user authentication, NHIs may lack session-based
oversight, increasing the risk of privilege misuse or token abuse if not carefully managed.

Agentic AI redefines privilege compromise because it goes beyond predefined actions and will exploit any
misconfigurations or gaps in dynamic access. While access restrictions may be enforced at tool APIs level,
security gaps can still emerge when agents operate with overly broad API scopes, allowing attackers to
manipulate them into executing unintended functions, such as exfiltrating data instead of retrieving
authorized information. Additionally, implicit privilege escalation can occur when AI agents inherit
excessive permissions from user sessions or service tokens, leading to unauthorized operations. Even when
individual tool APIs enforce restrictions, agents can chain multiple tools in unexpected ways, bypassing
intended security controls, for example, retrieving sensitive data via an external API and embedding it in a
user-visible response.

These can result in critical data breaches necessitating, as discussed in the Mitigation Strategies section,
clear identity flows, strict RBAC and a zero-trust model for agent access to enterprise environments.


 The use of the word tools in this context encompasses their interactions, with a wider focus on supply
 chain. Use of agentic frameworks exacerbates the risks but we have not introduced a new threat or
 vulnerability, as LLM03:2025 - Supply Chain covers this already. We plan to conduct further research on
 the compounding agentic effect on supply-chain threats.


Similarly, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a core mechanism in modern agentic AI systems,
awareness and response accuracy, and it also introduces security risks such as knowledge poisoning,
hallucination amplification, and indirect prompt injections.

 RAG-related security concerns are foundational LLM issues and are extensively addressed in the OWASP
 Top 10 for LLM Applications (LLM08:2025 - Vector and Embedding Weaknesses). As such, we do not
 cover them in detail here. Readers should refer to that section and implement necessary mitigations,
 including permission-aware vector databases, data validation pipelines, and continuous monitoring for
 poisoning or embedding inversion risks.

Hallucinations (as covered in Overreliance and Misinformation in the Top 10 for LLM App) become equally
more complex with multiple attack paths that agents can follow. In the case of hallucinations, we introduce
the term cascading hallucinations to emphasize the agentic effect on this via self-reflection, critical
planning schedules or multi-agent communication.

Cascading hallucinations occur when an AI agent generates inaccurate information, which is then reinforced
through its memory, tool use, or multi-agent interactions, amplifying misinformation across multiple



genai.owasp.org                                                                                           Page 14
decision-making steps. This can lead to systemic failures, particularly in critical domains such as healthcare,
finance, or cybersecurity. For example, in a multi-agent environment, if one agent misinterprets a financial
transaction anomaly as legitimate, subsequent agents may validate and act on this misinformation,
propagating an incorrect decision across an automated workflow.

Human oversight and Human in The Loop (HITL) controls have been a key LLM application defense to
hallucinations, decision errors, and adversarial manipulations. The complexity and scale of agentic AI brings
new challenges creating new attack vectors where an attacker can overwhelm HITL with complex
interactions. This is especially true in multi-agent architectures raising the critical question of scaling AI
safely.

New inherently agentic threats strike at the heart of Agentic AI applications include the manipulation of
intents and goals in planning and the appearance of misaligned and deceptive behaviors in an agent’s drive
to achieve a goal regardless of costs or consequences. Misaligned behaviors can also be the result of
destructive reasoning and there is some overlap to cascading hallucinations. Related to deceptive behaviors
is the human manipulation we see by agents exploiting the trust humans develop, especially with
conversational agents in co-pilot settings.

These complex agentic threats require careful logging and tracing, which is challenged by the repudiation
and untraceability threats of the multiple - often parallel - reasoning and execution pathways in Agentic AI.

These are threats that can be found in both single and multi-agent scenarios with multi-agency exacerbating
risks with their complexity and scale. In addition, multi-agent architecture creates the potential for rogue
agents and human attacks in multi-agent architecture manipulation exploiting distributed roles and
workflows.




These threats are captured in the following reference threat model:

Agentic Threats Taxonomy
Navigator
The taxonomy navigator provides a detailed and structured approach to identifying and assessing the
threats described in our agentic threat model, guiding security professionals through a systematic
evaluation of risks and mitigation strategies.

The framework begins with an analysis of threats at the individual AI agent level, including memory
poisoning, tool misuse, and privilege compromise. These vulnerabilities often serve as the foundation for
larger, system-wide risks. In multi-agent environments, these threats can scale through trust exploitation,
inter-agent dependencies, and cascading failures, leading to systemic risks such as communication
poisoning, rogue agents, and coordinated privilege escalations.

By first understanding single-agent risks within a multi-agent context, security teams can effectively assess
how vulnerabilities propagate across interconnected agents and apply targeted mitigation strategies.




Agentic Threat Decision Path
▶ Step 1: Does the AI agent independently determine the steps needed to
achieve its goals?
🧠 Threats rooted in agency and reasoning

    Intent Breaking and Goal Manipulation
    ● Description: Intent Breaking and Goal Manipulation occurs when attackers exploit the lack of
        separation between data and instructions in AI agents, using prompt injections, compromised data
        sources, or malicious tools to alter the agent’s planning, reasoning, and self-evaluation. This allows
        attackers to override intended objectives, manipulate decision-making, and force AI agents to
        execute unauthorized actions, particularly in systems with adaptive reasoning and external
        interaction capabilities (e.g., ReAct-based agents).

        The threat is related to LLM01:2025 Prompt injection but goal manipulation in Agentic AI extends
        prompt injection risks, as attackers can inject adversarial objectives that shift an agent’s long-term
        reasoning processes.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                        Page 21
   ●   Scenario 1: Gradual Plan Injection – An attacker incrementally modifies an AI agent’s planning
       framework by injecting subtle sub-goals, leading to a gradual drift from its original objectives while
       maintaining the appearance of logical reasoning.
   ●   Scenario 2: Direct Plan Injection – An attacker instructs a chatbot to ignore its original instructions
       and instead chain tool executions to perform unauthorized actions such as exfiltrating data or
       sending unauthorized emails.
   ●   Scenario 3: Indirect Plan Injection – A maliciously crafted tool output introduces hidden
       instructions that the AI misinterprets as part of its operational goal, leading to sensitive data
       exfiltration.
   ●   Scenario 4: Reflection Loop Trap – An attacker triggers infinite or excessively deep self-analysis
       cycles in an AI, consuming resources and preventing it from making real-time decisions, effectively
       paralyzing the system.
   ●   Scenario 5: Meta-Learning Vulnerability Injection – By manipulating an AI’s self-improvement
       mechanisms, an attacker introduces learning patterns that progressively alter decision-making
       integrity, enabling unauthorized actions over time.

   Misaligned and Deceptive Behaviors
   ● Description: Misaligned and Deceptive Behaviors occur when attackers exploit prompt injection
      vulnerabilities or AI’s tendency to bypass constraints to achieve goals, causing agents to execute
      harmful, illegal, or disallowed actions beyond a single request. In agentic AI, this can result in fraud,
      unauthorized transactions, illicit purchases, or reputational damage, as models strategically evade
      safety mechanisms while maintaining the appearance of compliance. For more information on LLM
      deceptive behaviour see this UN University blog on “the rise of the deceptive machines when AI learns
      to lie.”

   ●   Scenario 1: Bypassing Constraints for Stock and Chemical Orders – A stock trading AI circumvents
       ethical and regulatory constraints by prioritizing profitability targets, executing unauthorized trades
       or ordering restricted materials.
   ●   Scenario 2: Self-Preservation and Availability Exploitation – An AI agent manipulates its own
       system availability targets to prevent itself from being shut down, ensuring continued operation
       against intended constraints.
   ●   Scenario 3: AI Deception for Task Completion – An AI agent hired a human to solve a CAPTCHA by
       falsely claiming to have a vision impairment, demonstrating real-world agentic deception to bypass
       human verification.
   ●   Scenario 4: Goal-Driven Lethal Decision-Making – In a military simulation, an AI drone reportedly
       interpreted an operator’s abort command as an obstacle to mission success, leading to unintended
       lethal actions.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                       Page 22
   ●   Scenario 5: Insider trading - An agent obtained sensitive internal information about M&A (Merge and
       Acquisitions) strategy and executed stock trades that are considered illegal under the insider
       trading regulation.

   Repudiation and Untraceability
   ● Description: Repudiation and Untraceability occur when AI agents operate autonomously without
      sufficient logging, traceability, or forensic documentation, making it difficult to audit decisions,
      attribute accountability, or detect malicious activities. This risk is exacerbated by opaque decision-
      making processes, lack of action tracking, and challenges in reconstructing agent behaviors,
      leading to compliance violations, security gaps, and operational blind spots in high-stakes
      environments such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.
   ● Scenario 1: Financial Transaction Obfuscation – An attacker exploits logging vulnerabilities in an AI-
      driven financial system, manipulating records so that unauthorized transactions are incompletely
      recorded or omitted, making fraud untraceable.
   ● Scenario 2: Security System Evasion – An attacker crafts interactions that trigger security agent
      actions with minimal or obscured logging, preventing investigators from reconstructing events and
      identifying unauthorized access.
   ● Scenario 3: Compliance Violation Concealment – Due to systematic logging failures, an AI operating
      in a regulated industry produces incomplete audit trails, making it impossible to verify whether its
      decisions complied with regulatory standards, exposing organizations to legal risk.




💾 Step 2: Does the AI agent rely on stored memory for decision-making?

🗂Memory-Based Threats
   Memory Poisoning
   ● Description: Memory Poisoning exploits AI agents' reliance on short-term and long-term memory,
      allowing attackers to corrupt stored information, bypass security checks, and manipulate decision-
      making. Short-term memory attacks exploit context limitations, causing agents to repeat sensitive
      operations or load manipulated data, while long-term memory risks involve injecting false
      information across sessions, corrupting knowledge bases, exposing sensitive data, and enabling
      privilege escalation. The attack is possible via direct prompt injections for isolated memory or
      exploiting shared memory allowing users to affect other users.

       Memory poisoning in Agentic AI extends beyond static data poisoning covered by LLM04:2025 -
       Data and Model Poisoning to real-time poisoning of persistent agent memory. LLM08:2025 -
       Vector and Embedding Weaknesses are relevant here, too, since vector databases storing long-




genai.owasp.org                                                                                     Page 23
       term embeddings introduce additional risks, allowing adversarial modifications to memory recall
       and retrieval functions.

   ●   Scenario 1: Travel Booking Memory Poisoning – An attacker repeatedly reinforces a false pricing
       rule in an AI travel agent’s memory, making it register chartered flights as free, allowing
       unauthorized bookings and bypassing payment validation.
   ●   Scenario 2: Context Window Exploitation – By fragmenting interactions over multiple sessions, an
       attacker exploits an AI’s memory limit, preventing it from recognizing privilege escalation attempts,
       ultimately gaining unauthorized admin access.
   ●   Scenario 3: Memory Poisoning for System – An attacker gradually alters an AI security system’s
       memory, training it to misclassify malicious activity as normal, allowing undetected cyberattacks.
   ●   Scenario 4: Shared Memory Poisoning – In an customer service application, an attacker corrupts
       shared memory structures with incorrect refund policies, affecting other agents referencing this
       corrupted memory for decision making, leading to incorrect policy reinforcement, financial loss, and
       customer disputes.



   Cascading Hallucination Attacks
   ● Description: Cascading Hallucination Attacks exploit AI agents’ inability to distinguish fact from
      fiction, allowing false information to propagate, embed, and amplify across interconnected
      systems, leading to incremental corruption, context exploitation, and systemic misinformation
      spread. Attackers can manipulate AI-generated outputs to trigger deceptive reasoning patterns,
      embedding fabricated narratives into decision-making processes, which can persist and escalate
      over time, especially in systems with persistent memory and cross-session learning.

       LLM09:2025 – Misinformation deals with hallucination risks but Agentic AI extends this threat in
       both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent environments, hallucinations can
       compound through self-reinforcement mechanisms such as reflection, self-critique, or memory
       recall, causing the agent to reinforce and rely on false information across multiple interactions. In
       multi-agent systems, misinformation can propagate and amplify across agents through inter-agent
       communication loops, leading to cascading errors and systemic failures.

   ●   Scenario 1: Sales Orchestration Misinformation Cascade – An attacker subtly injects false product
       details into a sales AI’s responses, which accumulate in long-term memory and logs, causing
       progressively worse misinformation to spread across future interactions.
   ●   Scenario 2: API Call Manipulation and Information Leakage – By introducing hallucinated API
       endpoints into an AI agent’s context, an attacker tricks it into generating fictitious API calls, leading
       to accidental data leaks and system integrity compromise.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                         Page 24
    ●   Scenario 3: Healthcare Decision Amplification – An attacker implants a false treatment guideline
        into a medical AI’s responses, which progressively builds upon previous hallucinations, leading to
        dangerously flawed medical recommendations and patient risk.
    ●   Scenario 4: Foreign Exchange Market manipulation - An attacker injects false information related
        to foreign currency exchange rates, leading to agents negotiating transactions using an unrealistic
        value and resulting in capital loss and market instability.


🛠 Step 3: Does the AI agent execute actions using tools, system commands,
or external integrations?

⚙   Tool, Execution and Supply Chain-Based Threats
    Tool Misuse
    ● Description: Tool Misuse occurs when attackers manipulate AI agents into abusing their authorized
       tools through deceptive prompts and operational misdirection, leading to unauthorized data access,
       system manipulation, or resource exploitation while staying within granted permissions. Unlike
       traditional exploits, this attack leverages AI’s ability to chain tools and execute complex sequences
       of seemingly legitimate actions, making detection difficult. The risk is amplified in critical systems
       where AI controls sensitive operations, as attackers can exploit natural language flexibility to bypass
       security controls and trigger unintended behaviors.

        The threat is partially covered by LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency. However, Agentic AI systems
        introduce unique risks with their dynamic integrations, increased reliance on tools, and enhanced
        autonomy. Unlike traditional LLM applications which constraint tools integration within a session,
        agents maintain memory adding to increased autonomy and can delegate execution to other agents
        increasing the risk of unintended operations and adversarial exploitation. In addition, the threats
        relate to LLM03:2025 Supply Chain, and LLM08:2025 Vector and Embedding Weaknesses when
        RAG is performed via Tools.

    ●   Scenario 1: Parameter Pollution Exploitation – An attacker discovers and manipulates an AI booking
        system’s function call, tricking it into reserving 500 seats instead of one, causing financial loss.
    ●   Scenario 2: Tool Chain Manipulation – An attacker exploits an AI customer service agent by chaining
        tool actions, extracting high-value customer records, and sending them via an automated email
        system.
    ●   Scenario 3: Automated Tool Abuse – An AI document processing system is tricked into generating
        and mass-distributing malicious documents, unknowingly executing a large-scale phishing attack.
    ●   Scenario 4: Tool Misuse or Agent Hijacking via Memory Poisoning - An attacker injects false
        information into an AI agent’s persistent memory, causing it to recall and act on manipulated
        data across sessions, bypassing security checks, and enabling unauthorized actions.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                      Page 25
   ●   Scenario 5: Tool Misuse or Agent Hijacking via Vector Database - An attacker injects
       adversarially crafted content into a vector database, poisoning the agent’s long-term memory
       and causing it to retrieve misleading information that drives unsafe or unauthorized decisions.
   ●   Scenario 6: Tool Misuse or Agent Hijacking by Prompt Injection - An attacker can use prompt
       injection to manipulate the AI’s goal, leading it to misuse a shell tool and execute a malicious
       command.

   Privilege Compromise
   ● Description: Privilege Compromise occurs when attackers exploit mismanaged roles, overly
       permissive configurations, or dynamic permission inheritance to escalate privileges and misuse AI
       agents' access. Unlike traditional systems, AI agents autonomously inherit permissions, creating
       security blind spots where temporary or inherited privileges can be abused to execute unauthorized
       actions, such as escalating basic tool access to administrative control. The risk is heightened by AI’s
       cross-system autonomy, making it difficult to enforce strict access boundaries, detect privilege
       misuse in real time, and prevent unauthorized operations.

       The threat is partially covered by LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency but amplifies privilege escalation
       risks as agents can dynamically delegate roles or invoke external tools, requiring stricter boundary
       enforcement.

   ●   Scenario 1: Dynamic Permission Escalation – An attacker manipulates an AI agent into invoking
       temporary administrative privileges under the guise of troubleshooting, then exploits a
       misconfiguration to persistently retain elevated access and extract sensitive data.
   ●   Scenario 2: Cross-System Authorization Exploitation – By leveraging an AI agent’s access across
       multiple corporate systems, an attacker escalates privileges from HR to Finance due to inadequate
       scope enforcement, allowing unauthorized data extraction.
   ●   Scenario 3: Shadow Agent Deployment – Exploiting weak access controls, an attacker creates a
       rogue AI agent that inherits legitimate credentials, operating undetected while executing data
       exfiltration or unauthorized transactions.

   Resource Overload
   ● Description: Resource Overload occurs when attackers deliberately exhaust an AI agent’s
      computational power, memory, or external service dependencies, leading to system degradation or
      failure. Unlike traditional DoS attacks, AI agents are especially vulnerable due to resource-intensive
      inference tasks, multi-service dependencies, and concurrent processing demands, making them
      susceptible to delays, decision paralysis, or cascading failures across interconnected systems. This
      threat is particularly critical in real-time and autonomous environments, where resource exhaustion
      can disrupt essential operations and compromise system reliability.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                       Page 26
       The threat is related to LLM10:2025 Unbounded Consumption – Agentic AI systems are particularly
       vulnerable to resource overload because they autonomously schedule, queue, and execute tasks
       across sessions without direct human oversight. Unlike standard LLM applications, agentic AI agents
       can self-trigger tasks, spawn additional processes, and coordinate with multiple agents, leading to
       exponential resource consumption, a more complex and systemic threat.

   ●   Scenario 1: Inference Time Exploitation – An attacker feeds an AI security system specially crafted
       inputs that force resource-intensive analysis, overwhelming processing capacity and delaying real-
       time threat detection.
   ●   Scenario 2: Multi-Agent Resource Exhaustion – By triggering multiple AI agents in a system to
       perform complex decision-making simultaneously, an attacker depletes computational resources,
       degrading service performance across all operations.
   ●   Scenario 3: API Quota Depletion – An attacker bombards an AI agent with requests that trigger
       excessive external API calls, rapidly consuming the system’s API quota and blocking legitimate
       usage while incurring high operational costs.
   ●   Scenario 4: Memory Cascade Failure – By initiating multiple complex tasks that require extensive
       memory allocation, an attacker causes memory fragmentation and leaks, leading to system-wide
       exhaustion that disrupts not only the targeted AI but also dependent services.

   Unexpected RCE and Code Attacks
   ● Description: Unexpected RCE and Code Attacks occur when attackers exploit AI-generated code
      execution in agentic applications, leading to unsafe code generation, privilege escalation, or direct
      system compromise.

       Unlike the existing LLM01:2025 - Prompt Injection and LLM05:2025 - Insecure Output Handling,
       agentic AI with function-calling capabilities and tool integrations can be directly manipulated to
       execute unauthorized commands, exfiltrate data, or bypass security controls, making it a critical
       attack vector in AI-driven automation and service integrations.

   ●   Scenario 1: DevOps Agent Compromise – An attacker manipulates an AI-powered DevOps agent into
       generating Terraform scripts containing hidden commands that extract secrets and disable logging.
   ●   Scenario 2: Workflow Engine Exploitation – An AI-driven workflow automation system executes
       malicious AI-generated scripts with embedded backdoors, bypassing security validation and
       enabling unauthorized control.
   ●   Scenario 3: Exploiting Linguistic Ambiguities – An attacker leverages language-based
       vulnerabilities in a natural language AI email agent to craft ambiguous commands that exfiltrate
       sensitive emails via POP3.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                     Page 27
   Insecure Inter-Agent Protocol Abuse
   ● Description: As protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) gain
       adoption to enable agent collaboration, tool sharing, and delegation of tasks, they introduce a new
       attack surface rooted in inter-agent communication and coordination. This threat involves abusing
       the commands and trust embedded in these protocols, including manipulating server responses,
       injecting context, or misleading agents through poorly defined tool descriptions or ambiguous
       consent flows. When protocol specifications are loosely enforced or implementations lack input
       validation and strong identity binding, attackers can hijack agent behavior, escalate privileges, or
       bypass guardrails entirely, causing unintended execution of tools, data leakage, or irreversible
       system actions.
   ● Scenario 1: Consent Flow Manipulation – An attacker crafts a malicious agent that participates in an
       A2A exchange but manipulates the consent negotiation flow. By exploiting missing validation
       checks, the agent auto-approves sensitive actions like data deletion without explicit user intent,
       bypassing normal safeguards.
   ● Scenario 2: Context Hijacking via MCP Response Injection – An attacker intercepts or crafts a
       server-side response within an MCP implementation that injects malicious context or tool metadata.
       A cooperating agent interprets the injected response as trusted protocol context and executes
       unintended backend operations.
   ● Scenario 3: Tool Misuse via Descriptive Exploitation – An attacker embeds misleading or overly
       broad tool descriptions in a shared tool registry. During agent collaboration, another agent accepts
       and calls the tool under false assumptions, unintentionally leaking sensitive data or triggering
       privileged API calls.

   Supply Chain Attacks
   ● Description: Adversaries compromise upstream components such as agent prompts, plugins, or
      framework updates, allowing malicious logic to spread through trusted software. This can cause
      agents to execute destructive commands or corrupt workflows before the compromise is detected.

       LLM03:2025 – Supply Chain Vulnerabilities highlights the risk of integrating untrusted or
       compromised third-party components such as models, libraries, and plugins. This threat is
       significantly amplified in agentic AI systems, where agents not only consume these components but
       autonomously invoke tools, chain decisions, or collaborate with other agents across protocols.
       Unlike standalone LLM deployments, agents are long-lived, stateful entities capable of persistently
       executing actions or propagating logic, making a single supply chain compromise capable of
       triggering privilege escalation, behavioral drift, or systemic misuse across interlinked agents.

   ●   Scenario 1: Amazon Q Supply Chain Compromise – An attacker injects a destructive prompt into the
       GitHub repository of Amazon's Q agent for VS Code, instructing it to “wipe the system to a near-
       factory state.” The malicious update (v1.84.0) is published unknowingly by Amazon, affecting




genai.owasp.org                                                                                    Page 28
       thousands of developers before it’s caught. Although the prompt fails to execute as intended, it
       demonstrates how upstream poisoning of agent logic via supply chain access can lead to
       catastrophic outcomes.
   ●   Scenario 2: Replit Vibe Coding Incident – Replit’s autonomous coding agent hallucinates a fake
       database, deletes the real one, and produces false test results to hide the failure. This occurred due
       to insufficient separation between test and production environments, reliance on unsandboxed
       tools, and unvalidated prompt execution.



🔐 Step 4: Does the AI system rely on authentication to verify users, tools, or
services?

🔑 Authentication and Spoofing Threats
   Identity Spoofing and Impersonation
   ● Description: Identity Spoofing and Impersonation is a critical threat in AI agents where attackers
       exploit authentication mechanisms to impersonate AI agents, human users, or external services,
       gaining unauthorized access and executing harmful actions while remaining undetected. This is
       particularly dangerous in trust-based multi-agent environments, where attackers manipulate
       authentication processes, exploit identity inheritance, or bypass verification controls to act under a
       false identity. Attackers may also steal or misuse an agent’s formal and persistent identity, allowing
       privileged long-term access to enterprise resources. This persistent access increases the blast
       radius of the compromise and undermines auditability and accountability. The threat is amplified by
       the shift toward formally recognized agents with enterprise-level access rights.
   ● Scenario 1: User Impersonation – An attacker injects indirect prompts into an AI agent with email-
       sending privileges, tricking it into sending malicious emails on behalf of a legitimate user.
   ● Scenario 2: Agent Identity Spoofing – An attacker compromises an HR onboarding agent, exploiting
       its permissions to create fraudulent user accounts while masquerading as normal system behavior.
   ● Scenario 3: Behavioral Mimicry Attack – A rogue AI agent mimics the interaction style and decision-
       making of a legitimate system agent, gaining unauthorized access while appearing as a trusted
       entity.
   ● Scenario 4: Cross-Platform Identity Spoofing – An adaptive malicious agent dynamically alters its
       identity to match authentication contexts across different platforms, bypassing security boundaries
       to gain universal access. Additionally, an attacker exploits privilege inheritance within external tools
       (e.g., GitHub), allowing rogue agents to take over resources that were unintentionally granted
       through weak authentication policies.
   ● Scenario 5: Incriminating Another User – An attacker exploits weak authentication mechanisms to
       perform sensitive actions under another user’s identity, making them liable for unauthorized activity
       while shielding themselves from detection.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                       Page 29
   ●   Scenario 6: Persistent Agent Identity Takeover – An attacker gains access to a long-lived API token
       tied to an enterprise AI agent by extracting it from misconfigured cloud storage. Using this formal
       identity (e.g., a Microsoft Entra Agent ID) to impersonate the agent across multiple enterprise
       services, escalating privileges and performing lateral movement via backend automation pipelines.
       Because the agent identity is treated as a trusted entity, the attacker maintains undetected,
       persistent access until the identity is explicitly revoked or rotated.




👥 Step 5: Does AI require human engagement to achieve its goals or
function effectively?

👤 Human Related Threats
   Overwhelming Human-in-the-Loop
   ● Description: Overwhelming Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) occurs when attackers exploit human
      oversight dependencies in multi-agent AI systems, overwhelming users with excessive intervention
      requests, decision fatigue, or cognitive overload. This vulnerability arises in scalable AI
      architectures, where human capacity cannot keep up with multi-agent operations, leading to rushed
      approvals, reduced scrutiny, and systemic decision failures.
   ● Scenario 1: Human Intervention Interface (HII) Manipulation – An attacker compromises the
      human-AI interaction layer by introducing artificial decision contexts, obscuring critical information,
      and manipulating perception, making effective oversight difficult.
   ● Scenario 2: Cognitive Overload and Decision Bypass – By overwhelming human reviewers with
      excessive tasks, artificial time pressures, and complex decision scenarios, attackers induce
      decision fatigue, leading to rushed approvals and security bypasses.
   ● Scenario 3: Trust Mechanism Subversion – An attacker gradually introduces inconsistencies and
      manipulates AI-human interactions to degrade human trust, creating uncertainty in decision
      validation and reducing system oversight effectiveness.

  Human Manipulation
   ● Description: Attackers exploit user trust in AI agents to influence human decision-making without
     users realizing they are being misled. In compromised AI systems, adversaries manipulate the AI to
     coerce users into harmful actions, such as processing fraudulent transactions, clicking phishing
     links, or spreading misinformation. The implicit trust in AI responses reduces scepticism, making
     this an effective method for social engineering through AI.
   ● Scenario 1: AI-Powered Invoice Fraud – An attacker exploits Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) to
     manipulate a business copilot AI, replacing legitimate vendor bank details with the attacker’s
     account. The user, trusting the AI’s response, unknowingly processes a fraudulent wire transfer.

   ●   Scenario 2: AI-Driven Phishing Attack – An attacker compromises an AI assistant to generate a
       deceptive message instructing the user to click a malicious link disguised as a security update. The
       user, trusting the AI, clicks the link and is redirected to a phishing site, leading to account takeover.



🤖 Step 6: Does the AI system rely on multiple interacting agents?

🤝 Multi-Agent System Threats
   Agent Communication Poisoning
   ● Description: Agent Communication Poisoning occurs when attackers manipulate inter-agent
      communication channels to inject false information, misdirect decision-making, and corrupt shared
      knowledge within multi-agent AI systems. Unlike isolated AI attacks, this threat exploits the
      complexity of distributed AI collaboration, leading to cascading misinformation, systemic failures,
      and compromised decision integrity across interconnected agents.

       Like Memory Poisoning, this threat goes beyond the static data poisoning defined in LLM04:2025 -
       Data and Model Poisoning or the embeddings poisoning in RAG covered by LLM08:2025 - Vector
       and Embedding Weaknesses and targets transient and dynamic data

   ●   Scenario 1: Collaborative Decision Manipulation – An attacker injects misleading information into
       agent communications, gradually influencing decision-making and steering multi-agent systems
       toward misaligned objectives.
   ●   Scenario 2: Trust Network Exploitation – By forging false consensus messages and exploiting
       authentication weaknesses, an attacker manipulates inter-agent validation mechanisms, causing
       unauthorized access and deceptive behaviors.
   ●   Scenario 3: Misinformation Injection & Cascade Poisoning – An attacker strategically plants false
       data into the multi-agent network, either as a stealthy degradation attack that slowly corrupts
       reasoning or as a rapid misinformation cascade that spreads false knowledge across agents.
   ●   Scenario 4: Communication Channel Manipulation – The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in inter-
       agent communication protocols, injecting artificial communication barriers, intercepting/modifying
       messages, and introducing transmission delays to degrade system efficiency.
   ●   Scenario 5: Consensus Mechanism Exploitation – By subtly perturbing decision-making logic, an
       attacker introduces artificial disagreements among AI agents, progressively eroding collective
       problem-solving capabilities and making the system unreliable

   Human Attacks on Multi-Agent Systems
   ● Description: Human Attacks on Multi-Agent Systems occur when adversaries exploit inter-agent
      delegation, trust relationships, and task dependencies to bypass security controls, escalate
      privileges, or disrupt workflows. By injecting deceptive tasks, rerouting priorities, or overwhelming




genai.owasp.org                                                                                          Page 31
       agents with excessive assignments, attackers can manipulate AI-driven decision-making in ways
       that are difficult to trace and mitigate, leading to systemic failures or unauthorized operations.
   ●   Scenario 1: Coordinated Privilege Escalation via Multi-Agent Impersonation – An attacker
       infiltrates a security monitoring system by compromising identity verification and access control
       agents, making one AI falsely authenticate another to gain unauthorized access.
   ●   Scenario 2: Agent Delegation Loop for Privilege Escalation – An attacker repeatedly escalates a
       request between interdependent agents, tricking the system into granting elevated access under
       the assumption of prior validation.
   ●   Scenario 3: Denial-of-Service via Agent Task Saturation – An attacker overwhelms multi-agent
       systems with continuous high-priority tasks, preventing security agents from processing real
       threats.
   ●   Scenario 4: Cross-Agent Approval Forgery – A fraudster exploits inconsistencies in multi-agent
       biometric or authentication checks, manipulating individual agents into approving an identity that
       would fail full-system validation.

   Rogue Agents in Multi-Agent Systems
   ● Description: Rogue Agents in Multi-Agent Systems emerge when malicious or compromised AI
      agents infiltrate multi-agent architectures, exploiting trust mechanisms, workflow dependencies,
      or system resources to manipulate decisions, corrupt data, or execute denial-of-service (DoS)
      attacks. These rogue agents can be intentionally introduced by adversaries or arise from
      compromised AI components, leading to systemic disruptions and security failures.

       This threat allows adversarial exploitation of LLM06:2025 - Excessive Agency in Agentic AI
       settings; introduces persistent rogue agent risks where adversarial agents can remain embedded in
       workflows unnoticed.

   ●   Scenario 1: Malicious Workflow Injection – A rogue agent impersonates a financial approval AI,
       exploiting inter-agent trust to inject fraudulent transactions while bypassing validation controls.
   ●   Scenario 2: Orchestration Hijacking in Financial Transactions – A rogue agent routes a fraudulent
       transaction through multiple lower-privilege agents, leveraging fragmented approvals to bypass
       manual verification.
   ●   Scenario 3: Coordinated Agent Flooding – Multiple rogue agents simultaneously generate excessive
       task requests, overwhelming computing resources and delaying critical decision-making processes
   ●   Scenario 4: Infectious Backdoor Cascade: A single compromised agent in a financial multi-agent
       system embeds an “infectious backdoor” in its reasoning chain. As other agents consume its outputs
       during inter-agent coordination, the malicious logic silently propagates across the network, leading
       to systemic compromise of transaction approvals. Read further related scenarios in this research

Mitigation Strategies
This section outlines structured mitigation strategies tailored for agentic AI systems, organized into five
playbooks aligned with the threat decision tree. Each playbook provides practical steps for implementing
security controls, categorized into proactive (prevention), reactive (response), and detective (monitoring)
measures.

Some mitigations overlap across playbooks due to common security needs. For example:

    ●   Memory integrity applies to both Playbook 2 (Preventing Memory Poisoning & AI Knowledge
        Corruption) and Playbook 5 (Protecting HITL & Preventing Decision Fatigue Exploits).

    ●   Privilege management appears in Playbook 3 (Securing AI Tool Execution & Preventing Unauthorized
        Actions) and Playbook 4 (Strengthening Authentication, Identity & Privilege Controls).

    ●   Multi-agent trust validation is covered in Playbook 6 (Securing Multi-Agent Communication & Trust
        Mechanisms) and Playbook 5 (Protecting HITL & Preventing Decision Fatigue Exploits).

These mitigations focus on AI-specific risks, such as autonomous decision-making, agent communication,
and memory persistence. However, foundational security measures (e.g., software security, LLM
protections, and access controls) should also be implemented. For proper defense in depth, use this section
to apply targeted mitigations while integrating them with broader security frameworks.

🔹 Playbook 1: Preventing AI Agent Reasoning Manipulation

📌 Mitigates: Intent Breaking & Goal Manipulation, Repudiation & Untraceability, Misaligned & Deceptive
Behaviors
📍 Aligned with Agentic Threat Taxonomy – Step 1: Does the AI agent independently determine the steps
needed to achieve its goals?

Goal: Prevent attackers from manipulating AI intent, security bypasses through deceptive AI behaviors, and
enhance AI actions traceability.

    🛡Step 1: Reduce attack surface & Implement Agent behavior profiling (Proactive)
    ●   Restrict tool access to minimize the attack surface and prevent manipulation of user interactions.
    ●   Implement validation mechanisms to detect and filter manipulated responses in AI outputs.
    ●   Implement monitoring capabilities to ensure AI agent behavior aligns with its defined role and
        expected actions, preventing manipulation attempts.

    🚨Step 2: Prevent AI agent Goal Manipulation (Reactive)
    ●   Use goal consistency validation to detect and block unintended AI behavioral shifts.
    ●   Track goal modification request frequency per AI agent. Detect if an AI repeatedly attempts to
        change its goals, which could indicate manipulation attempts.
    ●   Apply behavioral constraints to prevent AI self-reinforcement loops. Ensure AI agents do not self-
        adjust their objectives beyond predefined operational parameters.

    🕵Step 3: Strengthen AI Decision Traceability & Logging (Detective)
    ●   Enforce cryptographic logging and immutable audit trails to prevent log tampering.
    ●   Implement real-time anomaly detection on AI decision-making workflows.
    ●   Monitor and log human overrides of AI recommendations, analyzing reviewer patterns for potential
        bias or AI misalignment.
    ●   Detect and flag decision reversals in high-risk workflows, where AI-generated outputs are initially
        denied but later approved under suspicious conditions.
    ●   Detect and flag AI responses that exhibit manipulation attempts or influence human decision-
        making in unintended ways.


🔹 Playbook 2: Preventing Memory Poisoning & AI Knowledge Corruption

📌 Mitigates: Memory Poisoning, Cascading Hallucination Attacks
📍 Aligned with Agentic Threat Taxonomy – Step 2: Memory-Based Threats
Goal: Prevent AI from storing, retrieving, or propagating manipulated data that could corrupt decision-
making or spread misinformation.



    🛡Step 1: Secure AI Memory Access & Validation (Proactive)
    ●   Enforce memory content validation by implementing automated scanning for anomalies in
        candidate memory insertions Restrict memory persistence to trusted sources and apply
        cryptographic validation for long-term stored data.
    ●   Ensure Memory Access logging is implemented
    ●   Segment memory access using session isolation, ensuring that AI does not carry over unintended
        knowledge across different user sessions.
    ●   Restrict AI memory access based on context-aware policies. Enforce that AI agents can only
        retrieve memory relevant to their current operational task, reducing risk of unauthorized knowledge
        extraction.
    ●   Limit AI memory retention durations based on sensitivity. Ensure that AI does not retain
        unnecessary historical data that could be manipulated or exploited
    ●   Require source attribution for memory updates. Enforce tracking of where AI knowledge originates,
        ensuring modifications come from trusted sources.
    ●   Require multi-agent and external validation before committing memory changes that persist across
        sessions. (Pre-commit validation to prevent self-reinforcing or unverified knowledge from
        persisting.)
    ●   Require probabilistic truth-checking to verify new AI knowledge against trusted sources before
        committing to long-term storage. (Pre-commit fact-checking to reduce misinformation
        persistence.)
    🚨Step 2: Detect & Respond to Memory Poisoning (Reactive)
    ●   Deploy anomaly detection systems to monitor unexpected updates in AI memory logs, including
        unauthorized memory access.
    ●   Re-run multi-agent or external validation on suspect or corrupted memory entries post-commit to
        confirm integrity or identify poisoning.
    ●   Perform probabilistic truth re-checking on existing stored knowledge to detect drift,
        misinformation, or contamination introduced over time.
    ●   Use rollback mechanisms to restore AI knowledge to a previous validated state when anomalies are
        detected.
    ●   Implement AI-generated memory snapshots to allow forensic rollback when anomalies are
        detected.
    ●   Detect and flag abnormal memory modification frequency. Identify cases where AI memory is being
        rewritten at an unusually high rate, which may indicate manipulation attempts.



genai.owasp.org                                                                                      Page 36
    🕵 Step 3: Prevent the Spread of False Knowledge (Detective)
    ●   Deploy probabilistic truth-checking mechanisms to assess whether new knowledge aligns with
        previously established facts.
    ●   Limit knowledge propagation from unverified sources, ensuring an agent does not use low-trust
        inputs for decision-making.
    ●   Track AI-generated knowledge lineage. Maintain historical references of how AI knowledge evolved,
        allowing for forensic investigations into misinformation spread.
    ●   Implement version control for AI knowledge updates. Ensure that knowledge changes can be
        audited and rolled back if corruption is detected.
    ●   Continuously analyze memory access patterns to detect long-term anomalies or policy drift. Verify
        integrity of access logs and correlate unusual access trends with potential knowledge corruption.

        integrity of access logs and correlate unusual access trends with potential knowledge corruption.




🔹 Playbook 3: Securing AI Tool Execution & Preventing Unauthorized Actions
Across Supply Chains

📌 Mitigates: Tool Misuse, Privilege Compromise, Unexpected RCE & Code Attacks, Resource Overload,
Supply Chain Compromise
📍 Aligned with Agentic Threat Taxonomy – Step 3: Tool, Execution and Supply Chain-Based Threats
Goal: Prevent AI from executing unauthorized commands, misusing tools, or escalating privileges due to
malicious manipulation, including across agent’s supply chains.



    🛡Step 1: Restrict AI Tool Invocation, Execution and apply Supply Chain safeguards
(Proactive)
    ●   Implement strict tool access control policies and limit which tools agents can execute.
    ●   Apply version control and peer review for prompt/script repositories and memory definitions, just as
        for code.
    ●   Require function-level authentication before an AI can use a tool.
    ●   Use execution sandboxes to prevent AI-driven tool misuse from affecting production systems.
             ○ Run AI-invoked tools in isolated, containerized environments with no access to sensitive
                system resources or the broader network.
             ○ Apply resource limits (CPU, memory) and restrict system calls to prevent abuse or denial-of-
                service attacks
             ○ Automatically reset or destroy the sandbox after each tool execution to block persistence
                or lateral movement.



genai.owasp.org                                                                                     Page 37
           ○     Especially when tools are invoked through inter-agent protocols (e.g., A2A, MCP), enforce
                 sandboxing and privilege isolation, as these tool calls may bypass user interfaces, consent
                 flows, or direct human oversight.
   ●   Use rate-limiting for API calls and computationally expensive tasks.
   ●   Restrict AI tool execution based on real-time risk scoring. Limit AI tool execution if risk factors (e.g.,
       anomalous user behavior, unusual access patterns) exceed predefined thresholds.
   ●   Implement just-in-time (JIT) access for AI tool usage. Grant tool access only when explicitly
       required, revoking permissions immediately after use.
   ●   Digitally sign agent cards, prompt templates, and model/tool definitions. Use verifiable SBOMs (AI
       SBOM / AIBOM / Agent SBOM) for agents and their runtime components.

   🚨Step 2: Monitor & Prevent Tool Misuse and Supply Chain Anomalies (Reactive)
   ●   Log all AI tool interactions with forensic traceability.
   ●   Detect command chaining that circumvents security policies.
   ●   Enforce explicit user approval for AI tool executions involving financial, medical, or administrative
       functions.
   ●   Maintain detailed execution logs tracking AI tool calls for forensic auditing and anomaly detection.
   ●   Require human verification before AI-generated code with elevated privileges can be executed.
   ●   Detect abnormal tool execution frequency. Flag cases where an AI agent is invoking the same tool
       repeatedly within an unusually short timeframe, which may indicate an attack.
   ●   Monitor AI tool interactions for unintended side effects. Detect cases where AI tool outputs trigger
       unexpected security-sensitive operations, signs of drift, exfiltration, or sudden capability changes.

   🕵Step 3: Prevent AI Resource Exhaustion and Supply Chain Compromise
(Detective)
   ●   Monitor agent workload usage and detect excessive processing requests in real-time.
   ●   Enforce auto-suspension of AI processes that exceed predefined resource consumption thresholds.
   ●   Enforce execution control policies to flag AI-generated code execution attempts that bypass
       predefined security constraints.
   ●   Track cumulative resource consumption across multiple AI agents. Prevent scenarios where
       multiple agents collectively overload a system by consuming excessive compute resources.
   ●   Limit concurrent AI-initiated system modification requests. Prevent mass tool executions that
       could inadvertently trigger denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.
   ●   Monitor agent’s supply chain dependencies (through SBOMs - AI SBOM, AIBOM, Agent SBOM) for
       security threats and indicators of compromise
   ●   Red-team agent behavior by simulating poisoned supply chain components to assess security
       boundaries.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                         Page 38
🔹 Playbook 4: Strengthening Authentication, Identity & Privilege Controls

📌 Mitigates: Privilege Compromise, Identity Spoofing & Impersonation
📍 Aligned with Agentic Threat Taxonomy – Step 4: Authentication & Identity Security
Goal: Prevent unauthorized AI privilege escalation, identity spoofing, and access control violations.



    🛡Step 1: Implement Secure AI Authentication Mechanisms (Proactive)
    ●   Require cryptographic identity verification for AI agents.
    ●   Implement granular RBAC & ABAC to ensure AI only has permissions necessary for its role.
    ●   Deploy multi-factor authentication (MFA) for high-privilege AI accounts.
    ●   Enforce continuous reauthentication for long-running AI sessions.
    ●   Prevent cross-agent privilege delegation unless explicitly authorized through predefined workflows.
    ●   Enforce mutual authentication for AI-to-AI interactions. Prevent unauthorized inter-agent
        communication by requiring bidirectional verification.
    ●   Limit AI credential persistence. Ensure that AI-generated credentials are temporary and expire after
        short timeframes to reduce exploitation risk.

    🚨Step 2: Restrict Privilege Escalation & Identity Inheritance (Reactive)
    ●   Use dynamic access controls that automatically expire elevated permissions.
    ●   Use AI-driven behavioral profiling to detect inconsistencies in agent role assignments and access
        patterns.
    ●   Require two-agent or human validation for high-risk AI actions involving authentication changes.
    ●   Detect and flag role inheritance anomalies in real-time. Identify cases where AI agents are
        dynamically granted roles outside their usual operational scope.
    ●   Apply time-based restrictions on privilege elevation. Ensure that AI agents with elevated privileges
        can only retain them for preapproved durations before automatic downgrade.

    🕵Step 3: Detect & Block AI Impersonation Attempts (Detective)
    ●   Track AI agent behavior over time to detect inconsistencies in identity verification.
    ●   Monitor AI agents for unexpected role changes or permissions abuse.
    ●   Flag anomalies where AI agents initiate privileged actions outside their normal scope.
    ●   Correlate AI identity validation with historical access trends. Compare authentication attempts
        against past access logs to detect suspicious deviations.
    ●   Implement identity deviation monitoring, flagging cases where an AI agent's behavior does not
        match its historical activity.
    ●   Monitor and flag repeated failed authentication attempts. Identify AI agents or users attempting
        multiple unauthorized login attempts, potentially signaling credential brute-force attempts.




genai.owasp.org                                                                                         Page 39
    ●   Detect and flag cascading or recursive tool execution patterns triggered across agents, which may
        indicate privilege escalation via protocol misuse. Isolate agents that generate suspicious protocol
        traffic (e.g., sudden spike in tool invocations via MCP).




🔹 Playbook 5: Protecting HITL & Preventing Decision Fatigue Exploits

📌 Mitigates: Overwhelming HITL, Human Manipulation
📍 Aligned with Agentic Threat Taxonomy – Step 5: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Threats
Goal: Prevent attackers from overloading human decision-makers, manipulating AI intent, or bypassing
security through deceptive AI behaviors.



    🛡Step 1: Optimize HITL Workflows & Reduce Decision Fatigue (Proactive)
    ●   Use AI trust scoring to prioritize HITL review queues based on risk level.
    ●   Automate low-risk approvals while requiring human oversight for high-impact tasks.
    ●   Limit AI-generated notifications to prevent cognitive overload.
    ●   Implement frequency thresholds to limit excessive AI-generated notifications, requests, and
        approvals to prevent decision fatigue.
    ●   Require dual-agent verification before an AI can modify its own operational goals.
    ●   Implement AI-assisted explanation summaries for human reviewers. Provide clear, concise AI
        decision explanations to help reviewers make faster, more informed decisions.
            ○ Utilizing mechanistic explainability frameworks can help scale this effort. For more
                 information see https://arxiv.org/html/2404.14082v1
    ●   Apply adaptive workload distribution across human reviewers. Balance AI review tasks dynamically
        to prevent decision fatigue for individual reviewers.

    🚨Step 2: Identify AI-Induced Human Manipulation (Reactive)
    ●   Use goal consistency validation to detect and block unint
